After some thinking about what I wanted this app to be focused around, I thought of using it
as a tool for my current workplace. I work for a Hyatt hotel here in Carlsbad. Hyatt is a massive hospitality corperation
with hundreds of properties all aroud the world. Each property, like mine, has hundreds of employees with
with a large selection of departments and positions. Though on a much smaller scale, this app poses
as a tool giving the user the ability to view, search, add, or delete employees based off of their assigned key.
The stored data includes the employees key, last name, department, and their golbal ID, which Hyatts actually use to identify
their employess. **DISCLAIMER: THE GLOBAL ID'S ARE NOT REAL ID'S. THEY ARE JUST EXAMPLES**
